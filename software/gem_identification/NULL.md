## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to develop an **intelligent robotic arm** that automates the gemstone cutting process through robotics and artificial intelligence.  
Traditional gem cutting in Sri Lanka is labor-intensive, requires high skill, and often results in inconsistency.  
The proposed system introduces a semi-autonomous robotic solution capable of identifying, evaluating, and cutting gemstones with precision and minimal human intervention.

The research integrates **machine learning, robotics, embedded systems, and AI-driven decision-making** to create a prototype that can intelligently analyze gem characteristics and execute optimized cutting operations.

## ⚙️ System Workflow

The system performs **four key functions**:

1. **Robotic Arm Control**  
   A programmable robotic arm, built using servo motors and controlled by Arduino or Raspberry Pi, performs precise physical movements for cutting operations.

2. **Gem Identification**  
   A camera scans the gemstone, and a **machine learning model** classifies the gem type and estimates its weight based on image and sensor data.

3. **Gem Evaluation & Cut Planning**  
   The system analyzes the gem’s features and determines the optimal cutting method using **AI-based or rule-driven logic** to maximize gem value and minimize material loss.

4. **Cut Execution**  
   The robotic arm executes the cutting process according to pre-calculated angles and paths, producing a polished gem ready for further refinement or sale.
